1. Project Overview
Healthcare costs are a major concern worldwide. This project investigates how factors like age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and region impact medical expenses. A linear regression model is built and evaluated to predict potential costs based on individual characteristics.

2. Dataset
The project utilizes the [Dataset Name] dataset from Kaggle, which contains information on [Number of Samples] individuals and includes features such as:

Age
Sex
BMI
Number of Children
Smoker
Region
Charges (Medical expenses)

3. Methodology
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Handling missing values, outliers, and converting categorical variables into numerical format.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions, correlations, and relationships between features to uncover patterns and insights.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to potentially improve model performance (e.g., interaction terms, polynomial features).
Model Selection and Training: Building a linear regression model and training it on the prepared dataset.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.
4. Results and Insights
Summarize the model's performance on the test dataset.
Highlight the most important features influencing medical expenses.
Discuss any interesting patterns or findings from the analysis.
Visualize predictions vs. actual expenses.
5. Future Work
Explore the use of other regression models (e.g., polynomial regression, random forest).
Investigate the impact of additional features not present in the original dataset (e.g., pre-existing conditions).
Consider developing a web application or dashboard to make the predictions accessible to users.
6. Getting Started
Installation: List the required libraries and dependencies (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib).
Running the Code: Provide clear instructions on how to run your code (e.g., command line, Jupyter Notebook).
7. Acknowledgements
Mention any individuals, organizations, or resources that helped you with the project.
Cite the Kaggle dataset if you used it.
